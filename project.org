*** TODO Adapt, if need be, current architecture to current goals
**** TODO Define units based on the future goal
So that would be something like:
- Period recorder: record new periods in the current session
- Estimator: show estimates based on previous period length, and on the estimated number of period in this session
- Sessions exporter: Export all periods in all sessions of an activity
- Session starter: ends the current session and starts another one
- Activity reader: reads and make available all data from an activity file
- Activity writer: saves all of an activity's data in a file _after a change_
**** TODO Refactor the program so as to follow these units
*** TODO Write tests for current program
** Better predict the length of a session based previous sessions
Period length wax and wane over a session. Assuming that these length
change in a similar pattern for every session, use that
information to better predict the length of a session.
*** Dependency: [[#tdd]]
*** TODO Record all length for a session in a file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: record_length
:END:
**** TODO always make a backup of the activity file before writing it
*** TODO When making prediction for the length in a session, use data from the three previous sessions
** Make it possible to check the assumption that period length wax and wane in similar patterns over several sessions
It should be easy to plot the data of previous session.
*** Dependency: [[#record_length]]
*** TODO Add an option to easily export length of periods for all recorded sessions
Side effect of this choice: it also allow all kind of analysis, for instance of when attention usually drops
** Make it possible to change the predicted number of period during a session
It is possible that the length of the session is variable. It is also
possible to want to do more of a repetitive activity in the middle of
a session. Finally, it is possible to be wrong when entering the
number of predicted session

Changing the predicted number of period in a session without ending it should be possible.
*** Dependency: [[#record_length]]
*** TODO Make the begining of a session a different command than the command to record period in a session.
*** TODO At the start of a recording, if 10 times the 75th percentile of the last 10% of periods has passed since the last recording for that session, show a warning that the user might need to start a new session
** TODO Make that project somehow useful to other
*** TODO Figure out what that might be ...
*** TODO ...
*** TODO ...
*** TODO ...
*** TODO Write a README.md
